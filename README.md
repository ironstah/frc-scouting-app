# frc-scouting-app

# This application was created back in 2019 during my time in FRC 1671 as a programmer.
# A raspberry pi would be connected to a monitor that held CSV files containing data submitted. During an event, we would pass Android tablets to our club members. 
# The CSV files would be put into an Excel sheet and used to calculate how well a team is doing.
