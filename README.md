# frc-scouting-app

This application was created back in 2019 during my time in FRC 1671 as a programmer.
A raspberry pi would be connected to a monitor that held CSV files containing data submitted. During an event, we would pass Android tablets to our club members. 
The CSV files would be put into an Excel sheet and used to calculate how well a team is doing.

The current repo does not have the files from the old scouting app yet, but if I am able to locate the flash drive that contained it, I will upload it.
